# docker-compose-django
This is a Docker setup for a web application based on Django.

- The Django application is served by Gunicorn (WSGI application).
- We use nginx-proxy as reverse proxy and static files server. 
- SSL/HTTPS automatic generate and renew using [letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://hub.docker.com/r/jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion/)
- Static and media files are persistently stored in volumes.
- Python dependencies are managed through pip requirement.txt
- Use [Django version LTS 2.2](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)

## Motivation
I've been using docker in most of my Django projects. There's a lot starter or example to use docker to run the Django web framework available on Github. However, to have the proper configuration that fits my project requirement is a little tricky. So the way I created my own configuration is by observing at other configurations and read the documentation from an official docker site. So I hope someone could get inspired!

## Prerequisite
- Docker & Docker-compose: [Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) or [Windows](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-windows-10)

## Configurations
This project has a default host localhost, if you like to deploy it to your server you need to update this configuration:
1. HTTPS settings on [docker-compose file](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml)

```
VIRTUAL_HOST: yourdomain.com
VIRTUAL_PORT: 80
LETSENCRYPT_HOST: yourdomain.com
# Email use to register yourdomain.com to Letsencrypt
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL: youremail@gmail.com
```
Note: 
- Once you enable LETSENCRYPT_HOST & LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL the nginx-proxy will be automaticly generate https cert for you. simple right?
- Ignore this settings if you just want to run it in your localhost
- Ignore this if you want to use Cloudflare because Cloudflare already has its own https generated; otherwise, you will get redirect looping. 

2. [Dock-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen) for nginx configuration

I'm using dock-gen to generate Nginx settings from the template. So whenever I want to create demo, test, production, implement DTAP software development or create any subdomain with other containers, I don't need to do it manually. If you want to edit & add new route, caching config and etc, please do it on [nginx.tmpl](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/nginx-proxy/nginx.tmpl#L384)

3. Use Alpine-linux

The default configuration is not using Alpine. However, if you want to use Alpine and reduce the size of your container, you can change the DockerFile to [Dockerfile-alpine](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/Dockerfile-alpine). Take a look on [docker-compose](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml#L19) and change Dockerfile to Dockerfile-alpine
```
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-alpine

```

4. Replace "example" with your project name

Make sure to replace "example" with your project directory name in [nginx.tmpl](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/nginx-proxy/nginx.tmpl), [Nginx docker-compose](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/nginx-proxy/docker-compose.yaml), [docker-compose web & mysql](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) and also [DockerFile](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/Dockerfile) or [DockerAlpine](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/Dockerfile-alpine)

5. Database and django .env

If you would like to change the database and django env settings please see [.env](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/tree/master/.envs)


## How to use
We use Makefile to make our life easy. You can see the command list on [Makefile](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/Makefile) file. 
However, the first things to do to run this project is by: 

1. Create nginx-proxy network
```sh
make create-network
```
2. Create volumes to store files persistently.
```sh
make create-volume
```
3. Run nginx-proxy 
```
make up-nginx
```
4. Build the Django web
```
make build
```
5. Migrate
```
make migrate
```
6. Collectstatic files
```
make collectstatic
```
7. Create Super User
```
make createsuperuser
```

## Issues
***1. Static file or media not found***

Please make sure you have correct directory path files of static and media in your settings. Also check on [nginx.tmpl](https://github.com/rririanto/docker-compose-django/blob/master/nginx-proxy/nginx.tmpl#L384)
